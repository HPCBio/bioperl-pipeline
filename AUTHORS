The core of the BioPipe design and the beginning of the project are 
entirely based on the hard work of the people working at Ensembl
(www.ensembl.org), specifically: 

*Michele Clamp <michele@sanger.ac.uk>
*Arne Stabenau <stabenau@ebi.ac.uk>
*Val Curwen <vac@sanger.ac.uk>
*Simon Potter <scp@sanger.ac.uk>
*Eduardo Eyras <eae@sanger.ac.uk 

The bioperl-pipeline started off as a development project that branched off 
directly from the ensembl-pipeline project 
(http://cvsweb.sanger.ac.uk/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/ensembl-pipeline/), 
aiming to make the code more usable within the generic OpenBio framework, 
and in particular bioperl. BioPipe would have not been possible without 
the fantastic work that resides at its core, the ensembl pipeline.

The core of the pipeline, i.e. the concepts/objects of analysis, job,
job status, etc. are derived directly from the ensembl pipeline. What the 
BioPipe developers have been focusing mostly on is the IOHandler system,
the XML layer, converters, filters,etc.

It should be stressed also that BioPipe is currently aimed at small-medium
data analysis projects, and simple genome annotation tasks, while the ensembl
pipeline is much better geared to complex genome annotation, analysis and 
complex gene building.
