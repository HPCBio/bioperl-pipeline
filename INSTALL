Installation of bioperl-pipeline requires XML::SimpleObject.pm which can be obtained from
CPAN. bioperl-pipeline also requires the Bioperl bioperl-run package and the main Bioperl
package, eiher bioperl-live or the latest stable release.

Install the bioperl-pipeline package in the standard way:

   >perl Makefile.PL
   >make
   >make test
   >make install

For detailed instructions on installing bioperl* packages please refer to the INSTALL document
in bioperl-live or in the latest Bioperl release. This document discusses issues like
installation into non-standard locations or how to install a Perl package if you don't
have root access (Unix).

Installation of Bioperl on Windows is discussed in the INSTALL.WIN document in bioperl-live
or in the latest Bioperl release.

The bioperl-pipeline relies on a MySQL database for its job management and tracking.
This allows persistence of most operations inherent to the pipeline, which
in turn allows the pipeline to restart seemlessly even after an abrupt halt due
to some system failure (e.g. network problems, power cut, and so on). 

Obtain MySQL from wwww.mysql.org and refer to the MySQL documentation for installation
instructions. Once MySQL is installed and running you can create the bioperl-pipeline
database.

To create a pipeline database:

   >mysqladmin -u root create biopipe

To create the pipeline database tables:

   >cd bioperl-pipeline
   >mysql -u root biopipe < sql/schema.sql
