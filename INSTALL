The bioperl-pipeline relies on a mysql database for its job management and tracking.
This allows persistency of most operations inherent to the pipeline, which
in turn allows the pipeline to restart seemlessly even after an abrupt halt due
to some system failure (e.g. network problems, power cut, etc.)

1) Create a pipeline database:

>mysqladmin -u root create biopipe

2) Populate the database with the schema:

>cd bioperl-pipeline
>mysql -u root biopipe < sql/schema.sql
