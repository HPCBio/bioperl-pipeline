Bio::Pipeline::Rule

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Bio::Pipeline::Rule

   my $rule = Bio::Pipeline::Rule->new ( '-dbid'    => 1,
                                         '-current' => 1, 
                                         '-next'    => 2,
                                         '-action'  => 'NOTHING');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This object represents the conditional logic for workflow in the
pipeline.  Each Rule dictates for a given analysis what the next
analysis will be.  It also specifies any action to be taken before
going to the next job.  Usually this involves setting up of inputs for
the next analysis.

Each job runs a certain analysis on a specfic input.  When the job
finishes, it looks up the rule for its analysis (current) and see what
the next analysis to do will be. If there is one, depending on what
the action will be, it will create the next job with the same input
but for the next analysis.

  $job->current

the analysis dbID for the current analysis

  $job->next 

the analysis dbID for the next analysis

  $job->action

Specifies the preprocessing to be doing before next
analysis is to be carried out.

  Action
  -------------------------
  COPY_ID        copy the input id from the current 
                 analysis for the next analysis 
                 the new iohandler for the input is looked up
                 in the iohandler_map table
  NOTHING        Do nothing, tells the job to go quietly
  COPY_INPUT     copy this input means to copy the input_id along
                 with the iohandler for the input
  WAITFORALL     Wait for all jobs of this analysis to finish before
                 executing the rule.
