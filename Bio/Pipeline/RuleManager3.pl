# things LSF wants to know, i.e. queue name, nodelist, jobname (things that
# go on the bsub command line), plus the queue flushsize. This hash is
# passed to batch_runRemote which passes them on to flush_runs.
#
# The idea is that you could have more than one of these hashes to suit
# different types of jobs, with different LSF options. You would then define
# a queue 'resolver' function. This would take the Job object and return the
# queue type, based on variables in the Job/underlying Analysis object.
