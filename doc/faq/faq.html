            </p><hr></hr><h2>1. Biopipe questions</h2><a name="1"></a><p></p><a name="Q1.1"></a><h3>Q1.1: How do I start?</h3><p><b>A: </b>First install the components, as described in
      http://www.biopipe.org/bioperl-pipeline-install.html. Next steps:</p><p>- Create a DB for the pipeline, e.g genscan_pipe (follow the schema of course)</p><p>- Update the DB in the PipeConf.pm</p><p>- Populate the DB Tables (see Populating the Tables in INSTALL for more Info)</p><p></p><a name="Q1.2"></a><h3>Q1.2: What are the methods that I have to insert in the
	 datahandler table?
	 </h3><p><b>A: </b>The methods in the datahandler table are used to get
	 the input for the runnable and store the output of the runnable. If the input
object is in a database, we will be instantiating a new dbadaptor and
use its method to retrieve the data from the database. The data will be
the input to the runnable. The output of the runnable(an object) has
to be stored in the database. Hence the methods that do this has to be specified. Example:

      <p><table bgcolor="pink" border="0" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><font color="blue"><pre>
+----------------+--------------+---------------------------+------+
| datahandler_id | iohandler_id | method                    | rank |
+----------------+--------------+---------------------------+------+
|              1 |            1 | get_Contig_by_internal_id |    1 |
|              2 |            1 | perl_primary_seq          |    2 |
|              3 |            2 | get_ScoreAdaptor          |    1 |
|              4 |            2 | store_by_PID              |    2 |
+----------------+--------------+---------------------------+------+
    </pre></font></td></tr></table></p>
The method get_Contig_by_internal_id gets the contig from the database
from its internal id. Then the perl_primary_seq is called upon the
contig to obtain a Seq object from the contig. The output from the
runnable (genscan) a seqfeature object will have to be stored back to the database (or other database). Hence the adaptor for the database will obtain the scoreAdaptor via get_ScoreAdaptor method  and the score Adaptor will store the output in the database by the store_by_PID method.
         </p><p></p><a name="Q1.3"></a><h3>Q1.3: What should be inserted in the field 'name' in the argument table?</h3><p><b>A: </b>The argument table is for the arguments required by the methods in the datahandler table. Example:
    
    <p><table bgcolor="pink" border="0" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><font color="blue"><pre>
+-------------+----------------+--------+------+--------+
| argument_id | datahandler_id | name   | rank | type   |
+-------------+----------------+--------+------+--------+
|           1 |              1 | INPUT  |    1 | SCALAR |
|           2 |              4 | OUTPUT |    1 | SCALAR |
+-------------+----------------+--------+------+--------+
    </pre></font></td></tr></table></p>
Since only two methods take arguments (in this case) there are only 2
entries in the arguments table. In the field 'name',there entries
'INPUT' and 'OUTPUT'. The method with corresponding datahandler_id's 1 and 4 are the methods that retrieve the input and store the output respectively.
         </p><p></p><a name="Q1.4"></a><h3>Q1.4: When I create the database for the pipeline should I manually create the tables?</h3><p><b>A: </b>
No. Users can copy the biopipelinedb-mysql.sql scheme when they create
         a new database. Hence they don't have to manually create
         tables. Steps:<p>- go to the directory where the schema file
         is then type these commands (assuming the dbname is testdb):</p><table bgcolor="pink" border="0" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><font color="blue"><pre>
       mysql>use testdb;
       Database changed
       mysql> source biopipelinedb-mysql.sql;
       </pre></font></td></tr></table></p><p></p><a name="Q1.5"></a><h3>Q1.5: In the input table, there is a field called 'name'. What's that?</h3><p><b>A: </b>When we fetch an input from the database based on
         certain fields, that field will be the name in the input directory.
      If the method get_Contig_by_internal_id is used, then the internal_id will be the name in this case. The name of every single entry has to be populated into the input table before running the pipeline.    
</p><p></p><a name="Q1.6"></a><h3>Q1.6: There are 2 dbnames, one in the analysis table and
         the other in the dbadaptor table. Are they the same?</h3><p><b>A: </b>No. The db in the analysis table is for analysis like
         Blast where it requires a database to blast against. The
         dbname in the dbadaptor table is the database(s) where the input is retrieved or stored.
</p><p></p><a name="Q1.7"></a><h3>Q1.7: The pipeline ran well the first time but didn't the
         second time. What could have gone wrong?</h3><p><b>A: </b>There could be many reasons for this. The most
         probable reason could be that you failed to empty the output
         and job tables after running the pipeline the first time. You might get a message like this:
      <p><table bgcolor="pink" border="0" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><font color="blue"><pre>
      Tests Completed. Starting Pipeline
      Fetched 0 jobs
      Waking up and run again!
      </pre></font></td></tr></table></p>
    The two tables have to be reset everytime the pipeline is run.  
</p><p></p><a name="Q1.8"></a><h3>Q1.8: The pipeline is not running. All the tables are
         populated correctly. What went wrong?</h3><p><b>A: </b>Again as in (7) there could be more than 1 reason for
         this. One possibility is that you might be getting messages like this:
<p><table bgcolor="pink" border="0" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><font color="blue"><pre>
     Tests Completed. Starting Pipeline
     Fetched 2 jobs
     opening bsub command line:
     bsub -o /data0/tmp//2/genscan_pipe.job_1.Genscan.1025852231.749.out -e /data0/tmp//2/genscan_pipe.job_1.Genscan.1025852231.749.err -q  /usr/users/savikalpa/src/bioperl-pipeline//Bio/Pipeline/runner.pl 1 2
     couldn't submit jobs 1 2 to LSF.
     Waking up and run again!
</pre></font></td></tr></table></p>
     This could be due to some problem in sending the job to LSF. Try
         running it locally (i.e. perl PipelineManager.pl -l) if it runs then it confirms this.
</p><p></p><a name="Q1.9"></a><h3>Q1.9: There are many tables that I left empty. Don't we need to put something in them?</h3><p><b>A: </b>Some of the tables like the job and output tables will be automatically populated as the pipeline runs.</p><p></p><a name="Q1.10"></a><h3>Q1.10: What about the output of the pipeline?</h3><p><b>A: </b>The output of the pipeline (i.e. gene object etc.) can be stored in any database of choice (need the dbadaptor of course).</p><hr></hr><p>Copyright (c)2002-2003 Open Bioinformatics Foundation.
