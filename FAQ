1.  How do I start?

Ans: -Start by creating a DB for the pipeline, e.g genscan_pipe (follow the schema of course)
     -Update the DB in the PipeConf.pm
     -Populate the DB Tables(see Populating the Tables for more Info) 

  

2.  Populating the tables


The datahandler table

each iohandler represents a series of steps that gets the input, writes the output etc.
Hence it is required to pass in the methods that implements this..
Ex: To pass a Bio Seq object to Genscan
DBAdaptor->get_contig(id).........method 1> get_contig  gives a contig1(Example)
contig1->perl_primary_seq.........method 2> perl_primary_seq gives a Bio::PrimarySeq object  (Argument for this will be INPUT as were passing this in.)
